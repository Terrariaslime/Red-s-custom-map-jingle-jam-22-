# Red's custom-map (jingle jam 22)

This was a special map made by red in 2022, and besides being made for the jingle jam event, it also was the first and only time so far we got the see the combo secret seeds worlds feature coming in the next update.

Although this map was neat, we sadly have lost the official download for it for a few months at this point, so I made this alongside a github page to "preserve" this one of kind map.
